        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Simple Promise:</strong> We don't collect, store, or access any of your personal data or message content.
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 21/07/2025 </p>
        
        <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
        <p>Unlike most online services, our secure messaging platform is designed with privacy at its core:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We don't ask for or store names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personal identifiers</li>
            <li><strong>No Message Content:</strong> Your messages are encrypted and automatically deleted after being read once</li>
            <li><strong>No Usage Tracking:</strong> We don't track your browsing behavior, IP addresses, or usage patterns</li>
            <li><strong>No Cookies:</strong> We don't use tracking cookies or any persistent storage on your device</li>
            <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We don't use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or any third-party tracking services</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How Our Service Works</h2>
        <p>Our secure messaging service operates on the principle of ephemeral communication:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Messages are encrypted before being stored temporarily on our servers</li>
            <li>Messages are automatically deleted immediately after being read once</li>
            <li>No permanent records are kept of any communications</li>
            <li>Each message has a unique, one-time access link</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Even though we don't collect personal data, we still maintain strong security practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All communications are encrypted in transit using HTTPS</li>
            <li>Messages are encrypted at rest on our servers</li>
            <li>Our servers are secured and regularly updated</li>
            <li>We follow industry best practices for data security</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We do not use any third-party services that would have access to your data or messages. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No advertising networks</li>
            <li>No analytics services</li>
            <li>No social media integrations</li>
            <li>No external APIs that could access your content</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Technical Information</h2>
        <p>The only technical information we may temporarily process includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic server logs for security and operational purposes (automatically deleted)</li>
            <li>Anonymous aggregate statistics (number of messages sent, but no content or user data)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we don't collect personal data, traditional data rights (like data portability or deletion requests) don't apply. However:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can use our service completely anonymously</li>
            <li>You control when and how your messages are accessed</li>
            <li>All messages are automatically deleted after reading</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If we ever change our privacy practices, we will update this policy and the "Last updated" date above. Since we don't collect contact information, we cannot notify users directly of changes.</p>
        
        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This service is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose</li>
            <li>Warranties of non-infringement, accuracy, or completeness</li>
            <li>Warranties regarding the security, reliability, timeliness, and performance of the service</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>NO LIABILITY:</strong> Under no circumstances shall we, our affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, or licensors be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Loss of data, profits, revenue, or business opportunities</li>
            <li>Personal injury or property damage</li>

        </ul>
        
        <p>This limitation of liability applies regardless of the theory of liability (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise) and even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitation of liability, so these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
