        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Simple Promise:</strong> We don't collect, store, or access any of your personal data or message content.
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> <span id="current-date"></span></p>
        
        <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
        <p>Unlike most online services, our secure messaging platform is designed with privacy at its core:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We don't ask for or store names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personal identifiers</li>
            <li><strong>No Message Content:</strong> Your messages are encrypted and automatically deleted after being read once</li>
            <li><strong>No Usage Tracking:</strong> We don't track your browsing behavior, IP addresses, or usage patterns</li>
            <li><strong>No Cookies:</strong> We don't use tracking cookies or any persistent storage on your device</li>
            <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We don't use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or any third-party tracking services</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How Our Service Works</h2>
        <p>Our secure messaging service operates on the principle of ephemeral communication:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Messages are encrypted before being stored temporarily on our servers</li>
            <li>Messages are automatically deleted immediately after being read once</li>
            <li>No permanent records are kept of any communications</li>
            <li>Each message has a unique, one-time access link</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Even though we don't collect personal data, we still maintain strong security practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All communications are encrypted in transit using HTTPS</li>
            <li>Messages are encrypted at rest on our servers</li>
            <li>Our servers are secured and regularly updated</li>
            <li>We follow industry best practices for data security</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We do not use any third-party services that would have access to your data or messages. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No advertising networks</li>
            <li>No analytics services</li>
            <li>No social media integrations</li>
            <li>No external APIs that could access your content</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Technical Information</h2>
        <p>The only technical information we may temporarily process includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic server logs for security and operational purposes (automatically deleted)</li>
            <li>Anonymous aggregate statistics (number of messages sent, but no content or user data)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we don't collect personal data, traditional data rights (like data portability or deletion requests) don't apply. However:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can use our service completely anonymously</li>
            <li>You control when and how your messages are accessed</li>
            <li>All messages are automatically deleted after reading</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If we ever change our privacy practices, we will update this policy and the "Last updated" date above. Since we don't collect contact information, we cannot notify users directly of changes.</p>
        
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or our practices, you can reach us through our <a href="/support/contact" style="color: #3498db;">support page</a>.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> This service is designed to be as private as possible. We can't access your messages, we don't know who you are, and we don't track what you do.
